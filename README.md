## Introduction

Location intelligence  is the process of deriving meaningful insight from geospatial data relationships to solve a particular business problem.

This projects addresses a particular problem for retail stores, called _"Branch Network optimisation"_. In this type of analysis, geospatial data are used to determine optimal location for retail branches in order to improve spatial coverage and fill gaps in the branch network. 

Here we will try to identify geospatial features that drive the loication of Migros Supermarket locations within the canton of Zurich, and feed this information to a machine learning model in order to identify additional promising locations for addtional branches
